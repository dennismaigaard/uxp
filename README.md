Welcome to a testing ground for all things front-end. Be aware: Noob in action - take caution and don't judge.
I am Dennis Teilmann Maigaard. A 34 year old male embarking on a coding journey trying to make sense of it all. This is my first project on Github.
I study to learn code using all available ressources on the web. I am curently using CodeAcademy to get aqquainted with HTML, CSS and Javascrpit. My goal is to master the arts of doing decent front-end code.
All advice and comments are very much appreciated. I am here to learn.
